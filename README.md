# Retail-Market-Prediction


 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages Google Trends API to analyze search interest in major electronics brands and predict market demand. It combines machine learning (XGBoost), time series forecasting, and statistical analysis to gain insights into consumer behavior.

🚀 Features

1️⃣ Demand Forecasting

Predicts future interest in electronic brands using Google Trends data.

Uses XGBoost regression for accurate predictions.

Evaluates model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

2️⃣ Competitor Analysis

Compares search interest trends among top electronics brands (Apple, Samsung, Sony, etc.).

Identifies which brands dominate the market over time.

Detects shifts in consumer interest across competing brands.

3️⃣ Seasonal & Event-Based Trends

Analyzes yearly seasonal trends (e.g., Black Friday, product launch cycles).

Identifies event-driven spikes caused by major events (e.g., Apple Keynote, CES).

Uses rolling averages & percentage change analysis to detect anomalies.
